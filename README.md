Deep Neural Networks implemented in Tensor Flow

The Fashion MNIST folder contains 3 Neural Nets:

BookNet.py - An implementation of a CNN Aurelien Geron used in his book "Hands-on Machine Learning"

LeNet - An implementation of Yann LeCun's LeNet-5 (CNN)

NeuralNet - A basic neural network used as a base line

These three models were tested on the Fashion MNIST data set. Source: https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist
